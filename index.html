        <h2>My Life story</h2>
        <p>I was born in China, my dad raised me until I was around 10, then I came over to Canada to meet my mom. I first went to Vancouver since I have a lot of relatives there, then after the summer break ended I came to Toronto for school. I went to Iroquois for grade five, virtual for grade six, and went to Henry Kelsey for grade seven & eight and now I'm in Albert Campbell.</p>
